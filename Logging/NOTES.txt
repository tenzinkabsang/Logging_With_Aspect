:=> Log4Net Configuration GOTCHA's

1. You MUST initialize Log4Net with a configuration call
	- log4net.Config.XmlConfigurator.Configure()
	- [assembly: log4net.Config.XmlConfigurator]

2. Make sure your LEVEL is not OFF
	<root>
      <level value="OFF"/>
      <appender-ref ref="File"/>
    </root>

3. Look for configuration errors in the debugger output window of Visual Studio

4. Make sure you've set layouts for appenders that require them

5. Make sure you've applied appenders to loggers
	<root>
      <level value="ALL"/>
      <!-- <appender-ref ref="Console" /> -->
    </root>

6. Log something as early as you can
